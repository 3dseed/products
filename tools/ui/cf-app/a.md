hi,
after spending now 4 weeks full time, I wanted to share our build and experiences.

Here first some requirements of the work station
- disposable design - using standard tubes or bars only - , along an easy to extend metal frame/table, leaving space for automation and being able to install all 4 machines on one setup
- must run stable, 24/7
- scaleable: the motor/reducer must be able to run 2 shredders, and 2 extrusions
- moveable with a car, for exhibitions
- safe and clear to use
- easy to manufacture components (drive shaft, couplings), reproducible by any classic machine shop, not more than a lathe, mill & CNC

status:

- compression/injector not build/integrated yet
- extrusion build but not wired and tested yet

references
- parts, prices, overhead and details here in a sheet
- build log (pictures for now only)

key performance indicators:

build time: insane, we've made the couplings, and extrusion our self
kw hours to produce & test: 180
used / new - ratio: 30/70
man power: 4 man weeks, full time
price - materials: 1400 Euro
price - labour: 1500 Euro (friend price)
real price: 3000 Euro (if used only new parts and market prices)
footprint - materials/labour: high
efficiency or production to produce this machine: 60%, 40% is lost for weird surprises

started addons (not incl. above)
- pulley system for filements: 30 euro
- regulated water beds to make filaments: 100 Euro
- integrated washing: 100 euro
- vibrators for the sive: 20 euro
- coolers for the extrusion: 100 euro (absolutely needed to make good filament)
- different hopper with pusher: 20 euro
- another gearbox with standard gears for the extrusion: 100 euro
- water proof control panels: 20 euro



Guenter is sitting right next to me. Yes I am writing here on his behalf but I can assure you that I have a full understanding of the issue and conflict here. We understand that you have and defend your very own interpretation of what “precious plastic” may means to you. Also I doubt that a single person can claim to speak for the entire community. We however, we speak for our machine builders and our communities. We picked the project up last year, due to requests from our communities here. Our goal was not to build a single shredder, far from that. There are around 10 stations ahead. This magnitude of quantity forces us to explore issues and real prices in deep. We have to make sure we can deliver a reproducible way of recycling plastic with a high efficiency and good results. That are basically proceedings of Dave’s attempts.

At this point we had to report the found issues here and we don’t understand why you refuse to update your materials with the numerous found issues and protect others whilst it is a matter of minutes to show some responsible acting.

Thanks for your understandings.

We just figured out that you deleted numerous posts from Guenter, exploring prices, fees and scope issues when building or ‘Getting into Precious Plastic’ reports. This is what he means by ‘irresponsible’ acting. We think it’s important to have evidence and first-hand reports to make the project viable and getting it finally out of the garage. You said it yourself, he has valuable input, ignoring his long-term engineer and volunteer experience with his background of 20 years professional activity in the field makes us wonder what your motivations are.

Please elaborate! As said, we’ve dedicated non trivial resources to Precious Plastic, long-term.
